# FFLaunch

The first Fair and Free Launch standard, inspired by the inscription.

Do you remember the recent inscription Summer?

Imagine combining inscription's FairLaunch feature with LaunchPad.

FFLaunch combines OutrunDao's other two products, "Outstake" and "Outswap," leveraging their strengths to create the fairest token issuance method in history.

Issuing ERC20 tokens like inscription, users can mint tokens by staking and lock ETH. During the minting process, The osETH generated from staking will be paired with a portion of tokens reserved in the contract to provide liquidity on Outswap. LP tokens will be locked for a period, and users will receive YieldTokens based on the locked staked ETH. After the lockup period, users can withdraw their osETH along with the LP tokens consisting of reserved tokens. This is equivalent to users getting these tokens for free while simultaneously participating in the entire liquidity-building process of the project.

For the project team, the funds they raise come from the trading fees collected by the trading pairs during the LP lockup period.With the core fundamental requirements mentioned above, we also provide customizable callee interfaces for project teams to support the flexibility of FFLaunch. This allows project teams to build their own unique launch logic on top of the Fair And Free foundation.

Compared to traditional ICOs or IDOs, the FFLaunch model is fairer and more investor-friendly. Investors can obtain the project's tokens for free, while also preventing the project team from conducting rug pulls or abandoning further development of the product after raising a large amount of funds, as is common in traditional IDOs. To raise further funds, project teams must continuously iterate on products during the LP lock-up period, encouraging users to trade their tokens. This facilitates sustained growth in cash flow. Furthermore, the FFLaunch model fosters community-driven liquidity. Since tokens are essentially obtained for free, this encourages more liquidity to be pooled, thereby increasing the depth of the liquidity pool. This is crucial for a newly launched project.

## Event Lifecycle

There are a total of 3 entities and 6 stages in the lifecycle of the FFLaunch event.

Entities:

1. Investor  
2. Outrun FFLauncher  
3. Third-party team

Stages:

1. Apply Stage  
2. Audit Stage  
3. Deposit Stage  
4. Claim Stage  
5. Open Trading Stage  
6. LP Settlement Stage

### Apply Stage

+ Third-party team develops Callee and Token contracts. The Callee contract must implement the IPoolCallee interface, while the Token contract should inherit from the FFT contract (with the ability to override certain methods).

+ Third-party team applies to list on Outrun FFLauncher, submitting detailed project and team information along with the Callee and Token contracts. Continuous communication with the OutrunDao audit team is required.

### Audit Stage

+ The OutrunDao audit team thoroughly reviews the submitted materials from the third-party team and engages in communication with them.

+ The OutrunDao audit team conducts an audit of the Callee and Token contracts submitted by the third-party team, checking for malicious contracts or security vulnerabilities.
If the audit fails, the OutrunDao audit team provides modification suggestions to the third-party team, which must then reapply.
If the audit passes, the OutrunDao audit team registers a new LaunchPool with Outrun FFLauncher.

### Deposit Stage

+ During the time between the registered Pool's startTime and endTime, users can call the deposit method of the FFLauncher contract to deposit funds into the temporary pool of that Pool. It's important to note that there is some overlap in time between the Deposit and Claim stages.

### Claim Stage

+ Before the claimDeadline of the registered Pool, users can call the claimTokenOrFund method of the FFLauncher contract to stake their deposits in the temporary fund pool to Outstake in order to obtain liquidity staking tokens and YieldTokens. They also invoke the Callee contract registered by the third-party team to add liquidity to Outswap. The LP will be locked in the FFLauncher contract. Subsequently, users will receive tokens from the third-party team.

+ After the claimDeadline of the registered Pool, it is the open trading stage. Users cannot claim tokens from the third-party team anymore. Instead, they will execute a refund operation to withdraw their funds from the temporary fund pool.

### Open Trading Stage

+ After the Claim Stage, the third-party team opens the trading switch, allowing tokens to be transferred freely and traded.

+ During this stage, the market-making profits generated by the LP locked in the FFLauncher contract will be obtained by the third-party team, constituting the funds raised by the third-party team.

### LP Settlement Stage

+ Once the LP lockup period expires, users can call the claimPoolLP method of the FFLauncher contract to withdraw the LP tokens locked during the Claim Stage. The third-party team will no longer receive LP market-making profits.
