## FFLaunch

### A truly community-driven token financing paradigm

The first Fair and Free Launch standard, inspired by the inscription.

Do you remember the recent inscription Summer? Imagine combining inscription's FairLaunch feature with LaunchPad.

FFLaunch combines OutrunDao's other two products, "Outstake" and "Outswap," leveraging their strengths to create the fairest token issuance method in history.

Issuing ERC20 tokens like inscription, users can mint tokens by staking and lock ETH. During the minting process, The osETH generated from staking will be paired with a portion of tokens reserved in the contract to provide liquidity on Outswap. LP tokens will be locked for a period, and users will receive YieldTokens based on the locked staked ETH. After the lockup period, users can withdraw their osETH along with the LP tokens consisting of reserved tokens. This is equivalent to users getting these tokens for free while simultaneously participating in the entire liquidity-building process of the project.

For the project team, the funds they raise come from the trading fees collected by the trading pairs during the LP lockup period.With the core fundamental requirements mentioned above, we also provide customizable callee interfaces for project teams to support the flexibility of FFLaunch. This allows project teams to build their own unique launch logic on top of the Fair And Free foundation.

### Not everything has a fixed price.
Compared to traditional ICOs or IDOs, the FFLaunch model is fairer and more investor-friendly. Investors can obtain the project's tokens for free, while also preventing the project team from conducting rug pulls or abandoning further development of the product after raising a large amount of funds, as is common in traditional IDOs. To raise further funds, project teams must continuously iterate on products during the LP lock-up period, encouraging users to trade their tokens. This facilitates sustained growth in cash flow. 

Furthermore, the FFLaunch model fosters community-driven liquidity. Since tokens are essentially obtained for free, this encourages more liquidity to be pooled, thereby increasing the depth of the liquidity pool. This is crucial for a newly launched project.

## Risk-Free LaunchPad

We can proudly proclaim that we are the first "risk-free" LaunchPad in history. For participating users, the risk is extremely low, and they can obtain a risk-free return similar to that of government bonds. Why can we say this?

Let's imagine a scenario where users participate in a LaunchPool with a fixed mintFee. Each user will incur the same cost for the tokens they receive since the mintFee does not change. The mintFee paid by users will be combined with a reserved portion of tokens to form an LP, which will be locked for a certain period. After the lock period expires, the LP will be returned to the users, and they will receive back the mintFee they paid along with the reserved portion of tokens.

### New tokens cannot be released during the liquidity lock period

Here’s the key point: under our supervision, all projects launched on FFLaunch cannot mint or release new tokens during the LP lock period. New tokens can only be released one week after the lock period expires. This means that even if all users simultaneously sell their tokens at the end of the FFLaunch event, in this closed system with no new tokens being added, when the LP lock period expires, they will regain their sold tokens and part of the mintFee. The scenario mentioned above only applies if no one buys tokens during the LP lock period. If new users do purchase tokens, all early participants will be rewarded.

### A win-win situation for Web3 users and project teams

In this "risk-free" scenario, the participation funds will exceed those of ordinary LaunchPads. The tokens will receive ample liquidity support and market attention, and the project team will earn sufficient fee income, achieving a win-win situation. This is the true primary market, not those fake IDOs. This is the true essence of Web3!!!

**_1. We particularly encourage verified startup teams to conduct community seed rounds on our platform, locking in for longer durations to secure continuous revenue streams for supporting project development_**

**_2. We also encourage meme coins with strong communities and operational teams to launch fairly on our platform, gaining continuous revenue streams to support community operations_**

## Moving like meme

Meme coins in Web3 represent an intriguing asset class. People often passionately support meme coins, even if they lack practical value. The rise of meme coins reflects retail investors' preference for more transparent, community-driven investment methods. This approach not only offers the potential for high returns but also allows investors to directly participate in market activities and enjoy the thrill of investing. Traditional VC coins, due to their complexity and potential for rug pulls, have led retail investors to explore other, more attractive investment options.

As a result, some Web3 developers are starting to feel discouraged, thinking that building a meme coin might be more rewarding than their efforts to create something substantial. This can indeed be disheartening for developers who are genuinely contributing to Web3. However, some clever developers are beginning to contemplate how to integrate the characteristics of meme coins into their projects or empower conventional Web3 projects with meme coin attributes. However, the most we typically see is hosting a meme drawing competition, which, frankly, is a rather ludicrous imitation. Now, I'm here to tell you that it's time for FFLaunch to make its entrance.

Throughout the entire lifecycle of the FFLaunch event, project teams are prohibited from minting or unlocking new tokens, ensuring that all tokens remain in the hands of retail investors. This makes it possible for project tokens to become meme coins during the event's lifecycle, and FFLaunch even creates a more favorable environment for genuine meme coins. During the event's lifecycle, users can freely trade project tokens as meme coins. Regardless of the eventual outcome, participants in FFLaunch can redeem their liquidity at the end of the event's lifecycle. Even if a project goes to zero during the event's lifecycle, FFLaunch participants can redeem the majority of their ETH, which serves as insurance for FFLaunch participants.

For project teams, they can organize a professional meme operations team and operate their project tokens as meme coins during the event lifecycle. This can increase user stickiness and activity for your project, while also earning transaction fees from users to support project operations. After the event lifecycle ends, you can then empower your meme coin to become a practical token, transitioning from a meme project to a practical project, completing a magnificent transformation.

## Advantages of Meme-Based Operations

Additionally, meme-based operations provide project teams with unique marketing methods and flexible operational strategies, enabling projects to stand out in a highly competitive market and achieve greater success.

## Benefits for Participants

### As an Investor Participating in FFLaunch

+ **Free Tokens:** Investors can mint tokens by staking ETH or USDB, without needing to purchase tokens directly, making the acquisition cost extremely low, effectively getting tokens for free.

+ **Low-Risk Returns:** Investors' staked funds can be redeemed after the lock-up period, meaning that even if the project fails, investors can reclaim most of their initial investment, achieving very low-risk returns.

+ **Continuous Earnings:** During the lock-up period, staked ETH or USDB will generate native returns, distributed in the form of REY and RUY YieldTokens, providing investors with additional earnings.

+ **Rug Pull Prevention:** The FFLaunch model prevents project teams from absconding with raised funds, ensuring fairer token distribution and protecting investors' rights.

+ **Tradeable Liquidity Proof:** Investors mint tradeable liquidity proof tokens when they lock liquidity. They can trade these tokens at any time, thereby managing their risk while their liquidity remains locked.

### As a Project Team Participating in FFLaunch

+ **Fair Fundraising:** By providing liquidity and a lock-up mechanism, project teams can ensure that the funds raised are more equitable and transparent.

+ **Continuous Cash Flow:** The project team can receive continuous financial support from transaction fees generated during the liquidity lock period, incentivizing them to continually improve and maintain the project.

+ **Enhanced Market Liquidity:** Since tokens are obtained for free, more users are attracted to participate, increasing the depth of the liquidity pool and enhancing market liquidity.

+ **Market Attention:** FFLaunch offers an innovative issuance model that can attract more market attention, especially from investors who are skeptical of traditional ICO/IDO models.

+ **Flexibility and Innovation:** Project teams can use ITokenGenerator interface (subject to review) to customize their launch logic, meeting specific needs and enhancing the project's uniqueness and appeal.

+ **User Stickiness:** Since investors hold shares of the liquidity locked during the FFLaunch genesis period, each genesis user is considered a shareholder during the liquidity lock period. This ensures that users continuously monitor their investments and potentially provide exposure opportunities for the project, significantly reducing operational obstacles for the project's cold start.

+ **Meme-Based Operations:** Given the meme attributes of FFLaunch tokens, project teams can engage with and communicate with users in unique ways through meme-based operations.

## Impact of FFLaunch on Outrun Ecosystem

### 1. Increasing Outstake's TVL

Users participating in FFLaunch will stake their ETH and USDB in the Outstake protocol. These staked assets will form liquidity pools (LPs) along with reserved tokens and will be locked for the same duration as the Outstake. 

+ Users will receive corresponding Blast native yield after staking ETH and USDB.
+ The total locked value (TVL) of Outstake will significantly increase due to the increase in staked assets.

### 2. Boosting Demand for osETH and osUSD

When participating in FFLaunch, the Outstake protocol will mint osETH and osUSD, which will be locked in Outswap. Users will need to use osETH or osUSD when purchasing tokens.

+ This will directly increase the demand for osETH and osUSD in the market.
+ Users may stake more ETH and USDB to acquire osETH and osUSD, or directly purchase these tokens from Outswap.
+ Consequently, the TVL and trading volume of Outswap will increase.

### 3. Cultivating User Usage Habits

During the prolonged period of locked liquidity, users will gradually become accustomed to trading with osETH and osUSD.

+ Long-term usage habits will help users accept and become accustomed to using these tokens, osETH and osUSD will serve as the base tokens for trading pairs.
+ With the addition of more trading pairs, an increasing number of users will use osETH and osUSD, further driving the prosperity of the Outrun ecosystem.

### 4. Breaking the Limitations of LST Usage Scenarios

Many Liquidity Staking Tokens (LSTs) face limitations in their usage scenarios, but FFLaunch provides an innovative way to overcome these limitations

+ By creating new usage scenarios on Outstake and Outswap, FFLaunch enhances the practicality of LSTs.
+ This strategy will attract more users, thereby increasing the activity and value of the entire ecosystem.

## Event Lifecycle

In the lifecycle of the FFLaunch event, there are a total of 3 entities and 6 stages:

### Entities

1. Investors  
2. Outrun Audit Team
3. Project Team

### Stages

**1. Apply Stage**

+ The project team develops TokenGenerator, Token, and TimeLockVault contracts. The TokenGenerator contract must implement the ITokenGenerator interface, and the Token contract inherits from the FFT contract (override certain methods). The TimeLockVault contract serves as a treasury for leftover tokens outside LaunchPool (can be updated before the remaining token generation stage by applying to the Outrun Audit Team).

+ The project team applies to the Outrun team for FFLaunch listing, submitting detailed project and team information along with TokenGenerator, Token, and TimeLockVault contracts, and maintains ongoing communication with the Outrun Audit Team.

**2. Audit Stage**

+ The Outrun Audit Team thoroughly reviews the submitted project team materials.

+ The Outrun Audit Team audits the TokenGenerator, Token, and TimeLockVault contracts to ensure safety and compliance.

+ The release conditions of the Token are checked to ensure that no new tokens are released during the LP lock period.

+ If the audit does not pass, the Outrun Audit Team provides feedback to the project team, who then need to reapply.

+ Upon successful audit, the Outrun Audit Team registers a new LaunchPool in the FFLauncher.

**3. Deposit Stage**

+ During the block time between the registered LaunchPool's startTime and endTime, investors can repeatedly call the depositToTempFundPool method of the FFLauncher contract to deposit into the temporary liquidity pool of that LaunchPool.

+ During the Deposit stage, investors can deposit into the temporary liquidity pool and then call the claimTokenOrFund method of the FFLauncher contract. This allows them to stake their deposit in the temporary liquidity pool into Outstake to obtain liquidity staking tokens and YieldToken. Simultaneously, they can generate the corresponding number of tokens by invoking the TokenGenerator contract registered by the project team. A portion of the tokens will be added to the liquidity with the investor's funds on Outswap, and the LP will be locked in the FFLauncher contract. The remaining tokens will be sent directly to the investors. At the same time, LiquidityERC20 tokens will be minted as proof tokens for the liquidity added by users, and these tokens can also be freely traded.

+ After the block time reaches the endTime of the registered LaunchPool, the stage transitions to the Open Trading stage. Investors can no longer claim tokens from the project team but can execute refund operations to withdraw their remaining funds from the temporary fund pool.

**4. Liquidity  Lock Stage**

+ Following the conclusion of the deposit stage, anyone can call the FFLauncher contract's enablePoolTokenTransfer method to enable token trading. Tokens can now be freely traded.

+ During this stage, the liquidity provider (LP) earnings locked in the FFLauncher contract accrue to the project team, providing continuous cash flow from the funds raised.

**5. Liquidity Unlock Stage**

+ After the liquidity lockup period expires, users can call the claimPoolLiquidity method of the FFLauncher contract to burn LiquidityERC20 tokens and withdraw the locked LP tokens.

+ The project team no longer receives liquidity market maker fee from this point onward.

**6. Remaining Token Generation Stage**

+ This stage begins 7 days after entering the LP Unlock stage. During this phase, the project team can use the FFLauncher contract's generateRemainingTokens method to mint remaining tokens into the TimeLockVault contract.

+ If the token is initially fully circulating, no additional tokens can be minted.

**These entities and stages collectively constitute the complete lifecycle of the FFLaunch event, ensuring the project's security, transparency, and compliance throughout its execution.**
