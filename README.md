# ⚖️ FFLaunch

### A truly community-driven token financing paradigm

The first Fair and Free Launch standard on the EVM, inspired by the inscription.

FFLaunch combines OutrunDao's other two products, "Outstake" and "Outswap," leveraging their strengths to create the fairest token issuance method in history.

Users can mint tokens by staking and locking **native yield tokens**. The [**PT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/pt.md) generated from staking these native yield tokens will be paired with a **reserved portion of tokens** in the contract to provide liquidity on the **Outrun AMM**. The LP tokens will be locked for a certain period, and users will receive [**YT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/yield-token.md) tokens in return for staking and locking their **native yield tokens.** Once the lock period expires, users can withdraw their LP tokens, which consist of their PT and the reserved tokens. This effectively allows users to obtain these tokens for **free** while continuously participating in the overall liquidity-building process of the project.

For the project team, the funds they raise come from the trading fees collected by the trading pairs during the LP lockup period.With the core fundamental requirements mentioned above, we also provide customizable callee interfaces for project teams to support the flexibility of FFLaunch. This allows project teams to build their own unique launch logic on top of the Fair And Free foundation.

### Not everything has a fixed price

Compared to traditional ICOs or IDOs, the FFLaunch model is **fairer** and more **investor-friendly**. Investors can obtain the project's tokens for free, while also preventing the project team from conducting **rug pulls** or abandoning further development of the product after raising a large amount of funds, as is common in traditional IDOs. To raise further funds, project teams must continuously iterate on products during the LP lock-up period, encouraging users to trade their tokens. This facilitates sustained growth in cash flow.

Furthermore, the FFLaunch model fosters **community-driven** liquidity. Since tokens are essentially obtained for free, this encourages **more liquidity** to be pooled, thereby increasing the depth of the liquidity pool. This is crucial for a newly launched project.

## Risk-Free LaunchPad

We can proudly proclaim that we are the first "**Risk-Free**" LaunchPad in history. For participating users, the risk is extremely low, and they can obtain a risk-free return similar to that of government bonds. Why can we say this?

FFLaunch is renowned for its fairness and zero-cost approach, complemented by the Outstake and Outrun AMM integration to form a closed loop. Users can obtain a portion of project tokens immediately by staking and locking **Native Yield Token**, rather than purchasing directly. Investors still benefit from native yields generated by staked assets. The minted [**PT**](https://outrun.gitbook.io/doc/outstake/yield-tokenization/pt) from staking are paired with another portion of project tokens on the Outrun AMM, where liquidity is added with a fee rate of 1%. LP tokens are locked in the FFLauncher contract and corresponding **tradable liquidity proof tokens** are minted.

During the LP lock period, **the fees generated from the trading pair accrue to the project team**, which can be claimed by invoking the FFLauncher contract. Upon expiration of the LP lock, investors can withdraw their locked LP by **burning the liquidity proof tokens** (or sell them earlier if preferred). For investors, this equates to acquiring project tokens at no cost, while the project team gains continuous revenue flow.

### New tokens cannot be released during the liquidity lock period

Under our audit of the token smart contract, all projects launched on FFLaunch **cannot mint or release new tokens** during the LP locking period. New tokens can only be released one week **after the lock period ends**. This means that even if no new buyers purchase the tokens and all investors participating in FFLaunch sell all their tokens after receiving them, within this closed system with no new tokens added, when the LP lock period expires, **investors will regain the tokens they sold**. FFLaunch can completely **prevent Rug Pulls** and allow investors to receive these tokens for **free**.

### A win-win situation for Web3 users and project teams

In this **"Risk-Free"** scenario, the participation funds will exceed those of ordinary LaunchPads. The tokens will receive **ample liquidity support and market attention**, and the project team will earn sufficient fee income, achieving a **win-win situation**. This is the true primary market, not those fake IDOs. This is the true essence of Web3!!!

## Moving like meme

Memecoins in Web3 represent an intriguing asset class. People often passionately support memecoins, even if they lack practical value. The rise of memecoins reflects retail investors' preference for more transparent, community-driven investment methods. This approach not only offers the potential for high returns but also allows investors to directly participate in market activities and enjoy the thrill of investing. Traditional VC coins, due to their complexity and potential for rug pulls, have led retail investors to explore other, more attractive investment options.

As a result, some Web3 developers are starting to feel discouraged, thinking that building a memecoin might be more rewarding than their efforts to create something substantial. This can indeed be disheartening for developers who are genuinely contributing to Web3. However, some clever developers are beginning to contemplate how to integrate the characteristics of memecoins into their projects or empower conventional Web3 projects with memecoin attributes. However, the most we typically see is hosting a meme drawing competition, which, frankly, is a rather ludicrous imitation. Now, I'm here to tell you that it's time for FFLaunch to make its entrance.

Throughout the entire lifecycle of the FFLaunch event, project teams are prohibited from minting or unlocking new tokens, ensuring that all tokens remain in the hands of retail investors. **This makes it possible for project tokens to become memecoins during the event's lifecycle**, and FFLaunch even creates a more favorable environment for genuine memecoins. During the event's lifecycle, users can freely trade project tokens as memecoins. Regardless of the eventual outcome, participants in FFLaunch can redeem their liquidity at the end of the event's lifecycle. Even if a project goes to zero during the event's lifecycle, FFLaunch participants can redeem the majority of their fund, which serves as insurance for FFLaunch participants.

For project teams, they can organize a professional meme operations team and operate their project tokens as memecoins during the event lifecycle. **This can increase user stickiness and activity for your project, while also earning transaction fees from users to support project operations**. After the event lifecycle ends, you can then empower your memecoin to become a practical token, transitioning from a meme project to a practical project, completing a magnificent transformation.

## Advantages of Meme-Based Operations

**Attracting Broad Attention**

* Viral Spread: Memecoins, due to their fun and entertaining nature, can quickly spread on social media, attracting significant attention and discussion, thereby increasing the project's visibility.
* Community-Driven: Memecoins often have strong community support, with members spontaneously promoting the project, creating a powerful network effect.

**Increasing User Stickiness and Activity**

* Entertainment and Interactivity: By leveraging meme-based operations, project teams can introduce interactive and entertaining elements, making user engagement more than just an investment but also an enjoyable and social activity.
* User Engagement: Users are more likely to feel a sense of participation and belonging through meme-based operations, leading to active involvement in various project activities and increased user retention.

**Reducing Marketing Costs**

* Community-Driven Promotion: Fans of memecoins usually promote the project spontaneously on major social platforms, reducing the marketing costs for the project team.
* Organic Growth: Through viral spread and community promotion, projects can achieve organic growth, decreasing reliance on paid advertisements.

**Enhancing Market Liquidity**

* High-Frequency Trading: Memecoins, due to their high popularity and attention, typically experience high trading frequency, increasing market liquidity.
* Attracting New Users: Meme-based operations can attract a large number of new users, especially young and entertainment-oriented investors, increasing market participation and liquidity.

**Increasing Token Value**

* Scarcity and Demand: During meme-based operations, limited issuance and high-frequency interactions can create token scarcity, increasing market demand and boosting token value.
* Long-Term Holding: Users with a high sense of participation and belonging are more likely to hold tokens for the long term, reducing market sell pressure.

**Innovation and Flexibility**

* Unique Marketing Approach: Meme-based operations offer innovations and flexibility that traditional marketing methods cannot achieve, allowing projects to interact and communicate with users in unique ways.
* Flexible Operational Strategies: Project teams can adjust their operational strategies based on community reactions and market feedback, maintaining market excitement and user interest.

Through meme-based operations, FFLaunch project teams can significantly enhance project visibility and market attention, increase user stickiness and activity, reduce marketing costs, enhance market liquidity, and raise token value. Additionally, meme-based operations provide project teams with unique marketing methods and flexible operational strategies, enabling projects to stand out in a highly competitive market and achieve greater success.

## Benefits for Participants

### As an Investor Participating in FFLaunch

* **Free Tokens:** Investors can mint tokens by staking Native Yield Token, without needing to purchase tokens directly, making the acquisition cost extremely low, effectively getting tokens for free.

* **Low-Risk Returns:** Investors' staked funds can be redeemed after the lock-up period, meaning that even if the project fails, investors can reclaim most of their initial investment, achieving very low-risk returns.

* **Preventing Front-Running and Dumping**: During the liquidity lock-up period, new tokens cannot be minted or released, preventing the project team from using initial users as exit liquidity.

* **Continuous Earnings:** During the lock-up period, staked Native Yield Token will generate native yields, distributed in the form of YieldToken(YT), providing investors with additional earnings.

* **Rug Pull Prevention:** The FFLaunch model prevents project teams from absconding with raised funds, ensuring fairer token distribution and protecting investors' rights.

* **Tradeable Liquidity Proof:** Investors mint tradeable liquidity proof tokens when they lock liquidity. They can trade these tokens at any time, thereby managing their risk while their liquidity remains locked.

### As a Project Team Participating in FFLaunch

* **Fair Fundraising:** By providing liquidity and a lock-up mechanism, project teams can ensure that the funds raised are more equitable and transparent.

* **Continuous Fund Flow:** Project teams can receive ongoing funding support from transaction fees generated during the LP lock-up period, incentivizing them to continuously improve and maintain the project.

* **Enhanced Market Liquidity:** Since tokens are obtained for free, more users are attracted to participate, increasing the depth of the liquidity pool and enhancing market liquidity.

* **Market Attention:** FFLaunch offers an innovative issuance model that can attract more market attention, especially from investors who are skeptical of traditional ICO/IDO models.

* **Flexibility and Innovation:** Project teams can use **ITokenGenerator** interface (**subject to review**) to customize their launch logic, meeting specific needs and enhancing the project's uniqueness and appeal.

* **User Stickiness:** Since investors hold shares of the liquidity locked during the FFLaunch genesis period, each genesis user is considered a shareholder during the liquidity lock period. This ensures that users continuously monitor their investments and potentially provide exposure opportunities for the project, significantly reducing operational obstacles for the project's cold start.

* **Meme-Based Operations:** Given the **Memecoin** attributes of FFLaunch tokens, project teams can engage with and communicate with users in unique ways through meme-based operations.

## Applicable Scenarios

For project teams, participating in FFLaunch not only provides a continuous revenue stream but also attracts a large number of users due to its low-risk nature, which can increase project exposure and offer ample liquidity for the token. FFLaunch is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:

1. **Verified Startup Teams:** Projects in the early stages of development with significant potential, especially those that have won awards in related startup competitions, can conduct a community seed round on FFLaunch. During this period, liquidity is locked until the **TGE** (Token Generation Event), allowing the project to iterate on the product and maintain engagement with the community.

2. **Mature Projects Preparing for TGE:** For projects that are already very mature and ready for **TGE**, where the project team and investment institutions have lock-up plans, FFLaunch can be used for public fundraising. Liquidity is locked until the team and institution tokens are unlocked, ensuring smooth project operation and increasing user retention during this period.

3. **Airdrop Preparation:** FFLaunch is also suitable for airdrop scenarios. Since FFLaunch supports custom token generators (subject to review), developers can authorize certain users on a whitelist to mint tokens through FFLaunch. Users can receive tokens for free, while liquidity is provided for the tokens. This approach keeps users engaged with the project even after the airdrop, unlike traditional airdrops where users often sell the tokens immediately and lose interest in the project.

## Event lifecycle

In the lifecycle of the FFLaunch event, there are a total of 3 entities and 6 stages:

#### Entities

1. Investors
2. Outrun Audit Team
3. Project Team

#### Stages

**1. Apply Stage**

* The project team develops TokenGenerator, Token, and TimeLockVault contracts. The TokenGenerator contract must **implement the ITokenGenerator interface**, and the Token contract **inherits from the FFT contract (override certain methods)**. The TimeLockVault contract serves as a **treasury for leftover tokens outside LaunchPool** (can be updated before the remaining token generation stage by applying to the Outrun Audit Team).
* The project team applies to the Outrun team for FFLaunch listing, submitting detailed project and team information along with TokenGenerator, Token, and TimeLockVault contracts, and maintains ongoing communication with the Outrun Audit Team.

**2. Audit Stage**

* The Outrun Audit Team thoroughly reviews the submitted project team materials.
* The Outrun Audit Team audits the **TokenGenerator, Token, and TimeLockVault contracts** to ensure safety and compliance.
* The release conditions of the Token are checked to ensure that **no new tokens are released during the LP lock period**.
* If the audit does not pass, the Outrun Audit Team provides feedback to the project team, who then need to reapply.
* Upon successful audit, the Outrun Audit Team registers a new LaunchPool in the FFLauncher.

**3. Deposit Stage**

* When the block time is between the registered LaunchPool's startTime and endTime, investors can call the deposit method of the FFLauncher contract to deposit **native yield token** into that LaunchPool. The native yield tokens will be staked in Outstake to obtain [**PT**](https://outrun.gitbook.io/doc/outstake/yield-tokenization/pt) and [**YT**](../outstake/yield-tokenization/yield-token.md). Simultaneously, the TokenGenerator contract registered by the project team will be called to generate the corresponding number of tokens. **A portion of these tokens** will be added to liquidity on Outrun AMM along with the PT, with the LP being locked in the FFLauncher contract, while the **remaining tokens will be sent directly to the user**. At the same time, **LiquidProof token** will be minted as proof of the liquidity added by the user, and these tokens can also be **freely traded**.
* After the block time reaches the endTime of the registered LaunchPool, it enters the **liquidity lock-up phase**, during which users can no longer stake native yield tokens to mint new tokens.

**4. Liquidity Lock Stage**

* Following the conclusion of the deposit stage, **anyone** can call the FFLauncher contract's enablePoolTokenTransfer method to enable token trading. Tokens can now be freely traded.
* During this stage, the liquidity provider (LP) earnings locked in the FFLauncher contract **accrue to the project team**, providing continuous cash flow from the funds raised.

**5. Liquidity Unlock Stage**

* After the liquidity lockup period expires, users can call the claimPoolLiquidity method of the FFLauncher contract to **burn LiquidProof tokens and withdraw the locked LP tokens**.
* The project team **no longer receives liquidity market maker fee** from this point onward.

**6. Remaining Token Generation Stage**

* This stage begins 7 days after entering the LP Unlock stage. During this phase, the project team can use the FFLauncher contract's generateRemainingTokens method to **mint remaining tokens into the TimeLockVault contract**.
* **If the token is initially fully circulating, no additional tokens can be minted**.

**These entities and stages collectively constitute the complete lifecycle of the FFLaunch event, ensuring the project's security, transparency, and compliance throughout its execution.**

## Impact on Outrun Ecosystem

### Increasing Outstake's TVL

Users participating in FFLaunch will stake their **Native Yield Tokens** in the Outstake protocol. These staked assets will form liquidity pools along with reserved tokens and will be locked for the same duration as the Outstake.

* Users will receive corresponding [**YT**](https://outrun.gitbook.io/doc/outstake/yield-tokenization/yt) after staking Native Yield Tokens.
* The total locked value (TVL) of Outstake will significantly increase due to the increase in staked assets.

### Boosting Demand for LSTs

When participating in FFLaunch, the Outstake protocol will mint [PT](https://outrun.gitbook.io/doc/outstake/yield-tokenization/pt), which will be locked in **Outrun AMM**. Users will need to use PTs when purchasing tokens.

* This will directly increase the demand for PT in the market.
* Users may stake more Native Yield Tokens to mint PT, or directly purchase these tokens from Outswap.
* Consequently, the TVL and trading volume of Outswap will increase.

### Cultivating User Usage Habits

During the prolonged period of locked liquidity, users will gradually become accustomed to trading with PTs.

* Long-term usage habits will help users accept and become accustomed to using these tokens, PTs will serve as the base tokens for trading pairs.
* With the addition of more trading pairs, an increasing number of users will use PTs, further driving the prosperity of the Outrun ecosystem.

### Breaking the Limitations of LSTs Usage Scenarios

Many Liquidity Staking Tokens (LSTs) face limitations in their usage scenarios, but FFLaunch provides an innovative way to overcome these limitations

* By creating new usage scenarios on Outstake and Outswap, FFLaunch enhances the practicality of LSTs.
* This strategy will attract more users, thereby increasing the activity and value of the entire ecosystem.

### Summary

FFLaunch increases Outstake's TVL by staking Native Yield Tokens, boosting the market demand for PT, and fostering user trading habits through long-term locked LPs. These measures will promote the prosperity of the Outrun ecosystem and break the current limitations of LST use cases, offering users more diverse and attractive options.
