# FFLaunch

The first Fair and Free Launch standard, inspired by the inscription.

Do you remember the recent inscription Summer?

Imagine combining inscription's FairLaunch feature with LaunchPad.

FFLaunch combines OutrunDao's other two products, "Outstake" and "Outswap," leveraging their strengths to create the fairest token issuance method in history.

Issuing ERC20 tokens like inscription, users can mint tokens by staking and lock ETH. During the minting process, The PETH generated from staking will be paired with a portion of tokens reserved in the contract to provide liquidity on Outswap. LP tokens will be locked for a period, and users will receive YieldTokens based on the locked staked ETH. After the lockup period, users can withdraw their PETH along with the LP tokens consisting of reserved tokens. This is equivalent to users getting these tokens for free while simultaneously participating in the entire liquidity-building process of the project.

For the project team, the funds they raise come from the trading fees collected by the trading pairs during the LP lockup period.With the core fundamental requirements mentioned above, we also provide customizable callee interfaces for project teams to support the flexibility of FFLaunch. This allows project teams to build their own unique launch logic on top of the Fair And Free foundation.

Compared to traditional ICOs or IDOs, the FFLaunch model is fairer and more investor-friendly. Investors can obtain the project's tokens for free, while also preventing the project team from conducting rug pulls or abandoning further development of the product after raising a large amount of funds, as is common in traditional IDOs. To raise further funds, project teams must continuously iterate on products during the LP lock-up period, encouraging users to trade their tokens. This facilitates sustained growth in cash flow. Furthermore, the FFLaunch model fosters community-driven liquidity. Since tokens are essentially obtained for free, this encourages more liquidity to be pooled, thereby increasing the depth of the liquidity pool. This is crucial for a newly launched project.
